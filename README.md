# User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) Dataset

This dataset contains raw and processed data from User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) responses collected during experiments comparing user experience across different user interfaces (UIs) and platforms, as well as between on-site teaching and a virtual training platform for law education.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized into two main directories:

1. **Data01**: Contains UEQ data files from experiments comparing user experience across different UIs and platforms, including:
   - 2D UIs on desktop.xlsx
   - 2D UIs in MR.xlsx
   - Hybrid UIs in MR.xlsx
   - 3D UIs in MR.xlsx

2. **Data02**: Contains UEQ data files from experiments comparing user experience between on-site teaching in a moot court laboratory ('On-Site.xlsx') and a virtual training platform for law education ('Virtual Training.xlsx').

Each data file includes two sheets:

- **Raw Data**: Contains the original participant responses on a 7-point Likert scale for each of the 26 UEQ items [1, 2].
- **Processed Data**: Contains the Sum/Average/Median scores for the six UEQ scales: attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, dependability, stimulation, and novelty [1, 2].

## Data Analysis

The statistical analysis of the dataset is available in the file from folder 'Data01' and 'Data02':
